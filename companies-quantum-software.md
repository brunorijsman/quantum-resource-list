## BEIT

The main goal of Beit is to design and implement an algorithm for solving an all relevant
NP-complete class of problems using Quantum Computers effectively, i.e. getting speedups better
than quadratic, guaranteed by theory. We focus on Hamiltonian cycle problem, but since there are
known reductions between different problems inside NP-complete class, we may say, that we are 
working on all of them at the same time. NP-complete problems are abstractions relevant for many 
real world problems encountered in logistics, manufacturing and warehousing at scale.
