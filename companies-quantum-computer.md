## Alice & Bob

We are working with superconducting circuits which is one of the most promising platforms for
building a quantum computer. Our unique technology of self-correcting superconducting quantum bit,
the cat qubit, allows for a much simpler road to fault-tolerant and universal gate-based quantum
computing.

## Atom Computing

Atom Computing is building truly scalable quantum computers out of individual atoms. Our quantum
computers use quantum mechanical properties of atoms to process information and solve problems
beyond the reach of traditional computers, including drug design, computational chemistry, and more.
