# Quantum Key Distribution: Open Source Software

Including Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) open source projects.

## Open Quantum Safe

The Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project is an open-source project that aims to support the development
and prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography. OQS consists of two main lines of work: liboqs,
an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, and prototype integrations
into protocols and applications, including the widely used OpenSSL library.

## Quantum Communications Hub CQP Toolkit

The system provides various components for integrating QKD into a security system. It's written in
C++11 but uses GRPC interfaces so can be integrated with lots of different languages.
